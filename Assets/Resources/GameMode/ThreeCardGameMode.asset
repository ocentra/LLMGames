      Data: "Three Card Brag Rules:\r\n1. Each player is dealt 3 cards at the start
        of each round.\r\n2. Players can bet blind (without seeing their hand) or
        see their hand before betting.\r\n3. Blind betting doubles the current bet.
        Players who have seen their hand bet double the current bet.\r\n4. Players
        can choose to fold, call, or raise at their turn.\r\n5. Players can draw
        a new card to the floor.\r\n6. Players can pick and swap a card from the
        floor. After picking and swapping, the player must decide to bet, fold, call,
        or raise.\r\n7. The highest hand value wins (Ace high). In case of a tie,
        the highest card wins.\r\n8. The game ends when a player runs out of coins
        or after a set number of rounds.\r\n9. The trailing player can continue if
        they have more coins.\r\n10. Players start with 1000 coins.\r\nSpecial Rules
        for Three Card Brag:\r\n11. Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank.
        Example: <color=#FF0000>J</color><color=#FF0000>\u2666</color>, <color=#FF0000>J</color><color=#FF0000>\u2665</color>,
        <color=#000000>J</color><color=#000000>\u2663</color>\r\n12. Royal Flush:
        Three cards in sequence of the same suit, starting from Ace. Example: <color=#000000>A</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>,
        <color=#000000>K</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>, <color=#000000>Q</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>\r\n13.
        Straight Flush: Three cards in sequence of the same suit. Example: <color=#000000>9</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>,
        <color=#000000>10</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>, <color=#000000>J</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>\r\n14.
        Straight: Three cards in sequence but not all of the same suit. Example:
        <color=#000000>4</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>, <color=#000000>5</color><color=#000000>\u2663</color>,
        <color=#FF0000>6</color><color=#FF0000>\u2666</color>\r\n15. Flush: Three
        cards of the same suit but not in sequence. Example: <color=#000000>2</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>,
        <color=#000000>5</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>, <color=#000000>9</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>\r\n16.
        Pair: Two cards of the same rank. Example: <color=#000000>Q</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>,
        <color=#FF0000>Q</color><color=#FF0000>\u2666</color>, <color=#000000>7</color><color=#000000>\u2663</color>\r\n17.
        High Card: When no other hand is achieved, the highest card plays. Example:
        <color=#000000>A</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>, <color=#FF0000>7</color><color=#FF0000>\u2666</color>,
        <color=#000000>4</color><color=#000000>\u2663</color> (Ace high)\r\n18. Trump
        Card: A designated card that can replace any card to complete a sequence
        or set. Example: Trump card is <color=#FF0000>6</color><color=#FF0000>\u2665</color>.
        Hand: <color=#000000>2</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>, <color=#000000>3</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>,
        <color=#FF0000>6</color><color=#FF0000>\u2665</color> (Trump card converts
        to <color=#000000>4</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color> to make straight
        flush: <color=#000000>2</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>, <color=#000000>3</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>,
        <color=#000000>4</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>)\r\n19. Trump in Middle:
        The Trump card is considered 'in the middle' if it is surrounded by cards
        on either side that form a continuous sequence. Example: <color=#000000>5</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>,
        <color=#FF0000>6</color><color=#FF0000>\u2665</color>, <color=#000000>7</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>
        (<color=#FF0000>6</color><color=#FF0000>\u2665</color> Trump card is in the
        middle)\r\n20. Adjacent to Trump: Cards adjacent to the Trump card provide
        a special point bonus, even if they do not form a valid hand. Example: <color=#000000>2</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>,
        <color=#000000>3</color><color=#000000>\u2660</color>, <color=#FF0000>7</color><color=#FF0000>\u2665</color>
        (<color=#FF0000>7</color><color=#FF0000>\u2665</color> is adjacent to the
        Trump card <color=#FF0000>6</color><color=#FF0000>\u2665</color> and receives
        points, but the hand does not form a valid sequence)."
