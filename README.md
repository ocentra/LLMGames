Cutting-edge suite of games designed to be played with large language models (LLMs), showcasing and benchmarking their capabilities in planning, understanding complex poker situations, and making strategic decisions. While the current focus is on a range of card games, including variants from 3-card Brag to 9-card poker, the vision extends beyond card games alone. The main idea is to test and benchmark LLMs in real-time gameplay scenarios while giving a broader audience a flavor of LLM capabilities. The offering includes traditional poker games with unique twists and exciting gameplay to ensure engagement for all players, not just LLM enthusiasts. Although LLM-based opponents are a key differentiator, LLMGames aims to provide a rich and dynamic gaming experience that appeals to a broad audience.
